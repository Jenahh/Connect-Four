About Connect Four Game in C++
Project Description
Welcome to the Connect Four Game in C++ project! This project is an exciting implementation of the classic two-player strategy game Connect Four, designed to run in the console. It offers a fun and interactive way to challenge your friends.

Features
Classic Gameplay: Enjoy the timeless rules and mechanics of Connect Four, where two players take turns dropping colored discs into a vertically suspended grid with the goal of connecting four of their discs in a row, column, or diagonal.

Player vs. Player: Challenge a friend or family member locally, taking turns on the same computer.

User-Friendly Interface: The game boasts an intuitive console-based interface, making it accessible to players of all ages.

How to Play
Launch the program in your chosen C++ development environment.
Follow the on-screen instructions to configure the game, including selecting player names, disc colors, and grid size.
Take turns dropping your discs into the grid.
The first player to connect four discs in a row, column, or diagonal wins the game!
If no player achieves four-in-a-row and the grid is filled, the game ends in a draw.
